AIMS OF A BASIC WORKBOOK\nA Basic Workbook is an independent digital form of work which is deemed to be an exam performance after \nsuccessful completion and documentation of all set tasks. By working on the individual tasks, you will be \nintroduced step by step to the process of independently writing academic papers and thus prepare yourself \nin an optimum and sustainable way for your further studies. You will frequently write academic papers up to \nthe bachelor's thesis within the framework of your exams.\n2. EXECUTION\n2.1 Preparation\nBEFORE you start working on the Basic Workbook, we recommend that you:\n1) Read the script.\n2) Familiarise yourself with the Library and Information Services (LIS) online library.\n3) Sign up for a Course Feed\u00ae in this course. There you can exchange information with fellow students \nabout the Basic Workbook and ask questions that have not yet been answered in the many resources \navailable on myCampus. The Course Feed\u00ae is supported by a tutor and is the only means of contact \nwith the tutors on this course.\n2.2 Creating a Basic Workbook\nPlease follow the steps below in full:\n1. Click on the link of the workbook tasks on the myCampus course page to download the Word document \nto your laptop, PC, etc. Answer the workbook tasks directly in the task file. Make sure that the formalities\nare observed (see point 4). You can return to a task at any time during the course to improve it or carry \nout further modifications if you wish.\n2. When you have completed all the tasks, please create 1 PDF document containing all the tasks. To do \nthis, go to \"Save as\" in Word and save the file in PDF format (please do not save as an image PDF, a \nprinter PDF, or a scanned file).\n3. Please title the complete file as follows: YYYYMMDD_Last name_First name_Matriculation \nnumber_Course code (e.g.: 20220116_Doe_John_12345678_SampleCourse01).\n4. Now upload the PDF document to Turnitin. You can find the instructions for this in myCampus in your \ncourse under \"Basic Workbook\". There you will also find out when you can expect the result of your\nexam.\n5. After uploading the whole file successfully, you have finished it!\n6. After the correction period, you will be informed whether you have passed or failed the course.\nEXAMS OFFICE\nIU.ORG\nPage 3 of 4\n3.

EVALUATION\nA Basic Workbook consists of six individual tasks and is assessed using IU International University of Applied \nSciences grading scheme and general grading scale. The evaluation consists of the respective workbook \ntasks and the format as well as the written work.\nEvaluation criterion Weighting\nWorkbook Task 1 15%\nWorkbook Task 2 12%\nWorkbook Task 3 13%\nWorkbook Task 4 20%\nWorkbook Task 5 20%\nWorkbook Task 6 10%\nFormat and written work 10%\n\nFAQ: BASIC WORKBOOK\nWhen do I have to submit the Basic Workbook?\n\u2022 The Basic Workbook can be submitted anytime.\nAre there any formal requirements for the Basic Workbook?\n\u2022 Yes, there are formal requirements for the Basic Workbook. These are written in the Guidelines for Basic \nWorkbook.\nWill I get a grade for the Basic Workbook?\n\u2022 No, it will only be distinguished by pass/fail. As soon as you have reached at least 50% of the points to be \nawarded, you have passed the Basic Workbook.\nHow do I submit the Basic Workbook?\n\u2022 Once you have completed all tasks, create one single PDF file. Make sure to name the file as follows (see \nInstructions for submitting work to myCampus Turnitin): YYYYMMDD_surname_name_matriculation \nnumber_course code; e.g., 20220314_Doe_John_12345678_DLBCSIAW01. Submit your PDF file to\nTurnitin via the link of the current month. The links will be activated successively. So, if only the next two \nmonths are visible in Turnitin, this is not meant to be a deadline. The other months are just not yet \nunlocked. Once uploaded to Turnitin, a file cannot be modified.\nWho do I contact if I fail to upload the Basic Workbook to Turnitin?\n\u2022 If there are problems with the upload itself (i.e. submission to Turnitin), please contact the Examination \nOffice (exams-office@iu.org). \n\u2022 If you have not titled the Basic Workbook correctly, you do not need to contact the Examination Office. \nIt may, however, result in a deduction of points.\nWhen will the results be announced?\n\u2022 The grading period starts at the beginning of the month following the end of the submission period\nand lasts six weeks. In total, it can take up to 10 weeks to receive your Basic Workbook grade \n(depending on how early into the submission period you submitted your Basic Workbook).\nExample:\nYou submit your Basic Workbook on July 2nd\n.\nThe grading period starts on August 1st\n.\nYour grade is published on September 13th\n.\nYou look at your published grade on September 13th at 23:59.\nThe Basic Workbook review will be activated at the end of the specified time.\nFAQ Basic Workbook DLBCSIAW01 Page 2 of 2\nCan I view the rating of the Basic Workbook and comments?\n\u2022 After the announcement of the results, you can see any comments made by the tutor. For this, click on \nthe title of your work. Furthermore, you can also select the digital receipt of your submission. To do so, \nclick on \u201cView Digital Receipt\u201d. The digital receipt is the confirmation of your submission. For this reason, \nwe recommend you take a screenshot of the digital receipt and save it.\n\u2022 Comments on the Basic Workbook will be activated as soon as all results of a submission month have \nbeen determined. Therefore, your results may already have been determined, but the comments are not \nyet visible. These will be unlocked in the next few days.\n\u2022 Please note: Comments are available for a period of four weeks after the rating has been published, but \nno longer after that.\nWho do I contact if I have any questions about the announcement of the results?\n\u2022 The grading of the Basic Workbook can take up to 10 weeks, as the six-week grading period does not \nbegin until the end of the submission month (see above). Example: Submission of Basic Workbook: July \n2\nnd | Start of the six-week grading period: August 1st | Announcement of result: September 13th\n.\n\u2022 If the result is not visible after the publication deadline, please contact the Examination Office: exams\u0002office@iu.org\nHow can I reach my tutor in the course DLBCSIAW01 \u201cIntroduction to Academic Work\u201d?\n\u2022 You can reach them via the Course Feed\u00ae.\nWhat should I do if I fail?\n\u2022 Once the result has been announced, you can upload a second/third attempt.\n\u2022 For a second attempt/third attempt, please upload the complete document with the addition \u201csecond \nattempt\u201d or \u201cthird attempt\u201d in the file name. Since the Basic Workbook does not have a cover page, the \naddition \u201csecond attempt\u201d or \u201cthird attempt\u201d has to be specified only in the name of the document (e.g.: \n20220314_Doe_John_12345678_DLBCSIAW01_SecondAttempt).\n\u2022 Please note that you must rework the tasks of the Basic Workbook completely! It is not sufficient \nto simply correct the errors from the first or second attempt.\n\u2022 For any questions, sign in (again) in the course feed\n\nGUIDELINE FOR AVOIDING PLAGIARISM\nYOUR FIRST WRITTEN ASSIGNMENT?\nHOW DO I START? WHERE DO I START?\nWithout the necessary support, it can turn into an enormous challenge and lead to students feeling completely \noverworked and stressed. Many of these problems and difficulties often occur after the written assignment has \nbeen turned in, in the form of a proof of plagiarism. An accurate citation format is the linchpin of a written \nassignment. Before you start writing, it is crucial to clarify what the accurate citation format is. Unfortunately, we \nhave often had the experience that students receive the proof of plagiarism, which isn\u2019t traced back to an attempt \nof cheating, but simply uncertainty. For this reason, the IU hopes that these guidelines help clarify all issues \nrelating to plagiarism so that unnecessary mistakes can be avoided. \n1. WHATIS PLAGIARISM?\nPlagiarism can generally be understood as the unauthorized usage of foreign intellectual property, or rather the \ntheft thereof (Fr\u00f6hlich, 2006, S. 81) where another\u2019s efforts are presented as one\u2019s own (Schimmel, 2011, S. 5).\nPlagiarism isn\u2019t always plagiarism, though. There are different types of plagiarism, with different dimensions.\nFirst an foremost, there is a difference between using passages of text, using foreign intellectual property, and the \nusage of one\u2019s own, previously published ideas (H\u00f6hner & Steinhauer, 2014, S. 27). When speaking about the \ntransfer of passages of text, a distinction is made between full and partial plagiarism. \nFull plagiarism\n- In the form of a full plagiarism, either most of the paper or all of it is completely taken from a single literary \nsource and then released as one\u2019s own work. This is done, for example, by switching out the cover sheet, or \nby simply reformatting the work plagiarized by the author. \n- Furthermore, one also speaks of a full plagiarism when a work in a foreign language is translated into one\u2019s \nown language. In all of these cases, it is referred to as intellectual property theft. \n- Another form of full plagiarism occurs when a ghostwriter is paid for having written the entire paper. (Ebster, \n2011).\nPartial plagiarism\n- In contrast to this is the so-called partial plagiarism, where the entire work is not plagiarized from one source, \nbut rather from several sources and incorporated into several different passages of the text. (H\u00f6hner & \nSteinhauer, 2014, S. 27). In the case of a plagiarism, which is not due to a literal adoption of a passage of text, \nbut rather the adoption of foreign ideas and arguments, one speaks of a so-called plagiarism of ideas. Here, \nthe ideas or arguments are presented in the author\u2019s own words, but also mistakenly presented as the \nauthor\u2019s own work (ebd., S. 27).\n- Additionally,it can also take the form of an \u201eindividual plagiarism\u201d. The author of a researchpaper isnaturally \nallowed to use his thoughts, arguments or his ideas more than once. This does, however, need to be\nreferenced throughout the paper. In this case, should the author fail to reference his firstpublication in the \npaper, this falls under self-plagiarism. While there is no evidence of theft of otherpeople\u2019s intellectual\nproperty,the reader isentitledtothe topicality ofthe idea and knowledge oftherespective background (ebd.,\nS. 27).\nPage 2of 3\nMisprints and errors are reserved. Date 03/22/2021\nEXAMS OFFICE\nIU.ORG\n2. TURNITIN\n- The IU uses the plagiarism software, Turnitin. The written assignments are to be turned in here, in order to \ncheck them or rather inspect them for plagiarism. \n- The Plagiarism software, Turnitin, gives indications or references whether sections of the assignment have \nbeen plagiarized. It is the responsibility of the examiner to decide whether or not the assignment has been \nplagiarized.\n- Furthermore, it is mandatory that a signed anti-plagiarism pledge is provided by the student in electronic \nform. Exceptions are final theses. Every bachelor's or master's thesis must contain a signed anti-plagiarism \npledge. In this Statement, the student ensures that he has completed their assignment independently.\n3. CONSEQUENCES OF PLAGIARISM\nIf an assignment has been turned in, where the student has plagiarized, the student involved will receive an \nattempt at cheating. In this case, the assessment will be graded \u201einsufficient \u201cand the Module, or rather half of \nthe module will not be acknowledged. Additionally, no credit points will be awarded.\n4. HOW CAN I AVOID PLAGIARIZING? \u2013 CHECKLIST FOR THE WRITING OF A\nRESEARCH PAPER\n- Both time and performance pressure are often causes for plagiarism. (V\u00f6lger Winsky, 2014, S. 12). Therefore, \nit is sensible, that you create a schedule before you begin writing your assignment, in order to best avoid \nfeeling overly constrained by time (Reichmann, 2013, S. 181).\n- Additionally, lack of ideas can also lead to plagiarism (Reichmann, 2013, S. 181). It is certainly permitted to \nuse unfamiliar ideas in your assignment, however, these need to be properly identified. For this reason, it is \nimportant, even when you are doing your literature research, that you immediately identify ideas, thoughts \nor arguments which emerge as you do your research, as well as citing the associated sources.\n- It is always good to structure newly acquired knowledge (V\u00f6lger Winsky, 2014, S. 15). Another words, while \nresearching and while creating a possible collection of quotes, be sure that you immediately cite your \nsources, so that you can avoid having to searching for your sources later on.\n- IMPORTANT: The Bibliography and citing of sources are as much a part of writing of the actual paper as is the \ntext itself. Always cite the sources as you are writing and update the bibliography every time you work on your \nassignment. \n- Simply including a bibliography in your assignment is not sufficient as the sole list of references. Do not forget \nto indicate your sources in the body of text.\n- If you would like to use verbatim quotes in your assignment, they must be cited and denoted accordingly. \nWith non-verbatim quotes, another words with analogous quotations, the content must be written in your \nown words. These must also be cited accordingly in the body of text.\n- If you are unsure whether or not to cite the source, cite the source when in doubt (Ebster, 2011).\n- Check your assignment, before you turn it in, to make sure that your Table of Contents and the list of sources \nare complete in main body of text, and make sure that you have quoted thoughts, ideas, and or arguments \naccordingly."}
